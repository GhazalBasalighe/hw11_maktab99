## Question 1: JavaScript Shape Calculator

In this section of the project, I've implemented JavaScript classes for various geometric shapes, allowing you to calculate their area and perimeter. The following shapes are included as classes:

- Square
- Circle
- Cylinder (a 3D shape)

You can use this functionality to perform geometric calculations. Here's how to use it:

1. Include the `shape.js` script in your HTML file.
2. Create instances of the shape classes with the required parameters (e.g., side length for a square, radius for a circle, etc.).
3. Call the `calcArea()` and `calcPerimeter()` methods on these instances to get the results.

For example, to calculate the area and perimeter of a square:

```javascript
const mySquare = new Square(5); // Create a square with side length 5
const area = mySquare.calcArea(); // Calculate the area
const perimeter = mySquare.calcPerimeter(); // Calculate the perimeter
console.log(`Area: ${area}, Perimeter: ${perimeter}`);
```

## Question 2: Interactive Web Interface

In this section, we've built an interactive web interface that utilizes the JavaScript shape calculator logic from Question 1. The interface is implemented using the Bootstrap framework, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.

To access the interactive interface:

    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    You'll see a form where you can select a shape, enter the required dimensions, and calculate its area and perimeter.
    The result will be displayed on the page.

This user-friendly interface simplifies geometric calculations for users.

## Question 3: Sliding Sign-In Page

In addition to the shape calculator, this project also includes a sliding sign-in page implemented with HTML and SCSS. The sign-in page features a stylish sliding animation for a modern and engaging user experience.

To access the sliding sign-in page:

    Open the sliding-sign-in.html file in your web browser.
    You'll see an attractive sign-in page with a sliding animation effect.

This component demonstrates HTML and SCSS skills, enhancing the overall project.
